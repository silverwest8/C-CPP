To  address  the  high  processing  cost  issue  of  keyword-based  analysis,  someresearchers have tried to develop image spam detection methods using low-levelfeatures that are directly extracted from images. Annadatha et al. [1] demon-strated that image spam emails could be detected with high accuracy using eitherPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) or Support Vector Machines (SVM). Tobuild a classifier, they manually selected 21 features (e.g., image color, objectedges) that can be extracted from spam and ham images. Shang et al. [19]proposed an alternative image classification method using a CNN model andan SVM classifier together, which is composed of 13 layers. The CNN modelproceeds classification in the last fully connected layer. However, they use theoutput from the last fully connected layer as the input for the SVM classifier.In this paper, we develop a more compact CNN-XGBoost model consisting ofDeepCapture4738 layers. Our evaluation results show that DeepCapture outperforms Shang etal.’s architecture in terms of detection accuracy. Fatichah et al. [8] also discussedthe possibility of CNN models to detect image spam. Unlike other previous stud-ies, they focused on building CNN models to detect the image spam on Insta-gram (https://www.instagram.com/), a social photo-sharing service. They evalu-ated the performance of four pre-trained CNN models (3-layer, 5-layer, AlexNet,and VGG16) with 8,000 images collected from Instagram. They found that theVGG16 architecture achieves the best accuracy (about 0.84) compared with theother models. Since VGG16 is a pre-trained network and its performance is notadvantageous, we do not directly compare DeepCapture with VGG16.We note that the performances of previous methods have been evaluated ondifferent data sets with different configurations. Therefore, we cannot directlycompare their reported performances. In this paper, we needed to reimplementtheir models and used the publicly available datasets to compare the performanceof DeepCature with those of the best existing models (SVM [1], RSVM [1]andCNN-SVM [19]).6  ConclusionIn  this  paper,  we  proposed  a  new  image  spam  email  detection  tool  calledDeepCapture. To overcome the performance degrade of existing models againstentirely new and unseen datasets, we developed a classifier using CNN-XGBoostand data augmentation techniques tailored towards the image spam detectiontask. To show the feasibility of DeepCapture, we evaluate its performance withthree publicly available datasets consisting of spam and non-spam image sam-ples. The experimental results demonstrated that DeepCapture is capable ofachieving 88% F1-score, which has 6% improvement over the best existing spamdetection model, CNN-SVM [19], with an F1-score of 82%. Furthermore, Deep-Capture outperforms other classifiers in cross data training scenarios to evaluatethe performance of classifiers with the new and unseen dataset.For future work, we plan to develop more sophisticated data augmentationmethods to add a more real-like synthetic dataset effectively. In addition, we willincrease the size of the dataset and examine any changes in detection accuracy.It would also be interesting to add the functionality of DeepCapture to an open-source project such as SpamAssassin.Acknowledgement.Hyoungshick Kim is the corresponding author.
